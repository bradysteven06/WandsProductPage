      <h2>Welcome to Hand Crafted Wands</h2>
      <p>
        At Hand Crafted Wands, we believe that every witch and wizard deserves a wand as unique as their magic.
        Nestled in the heart of the enchanted woods, our family-run workshop has been carving powerful instruments
        of spellwork for over three centuries. Whether you're a seasoned spellcaster or a young apprentice seeking
        your first wand, our master wandmakers are here to craft your perfect match.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each wand is imbued with ancient lore and created using ethically sourced magical materials — from phoenix feather
        cores to moonlight-bathed elderwood. You don't just buy a wand... you begin a lifelong partnership.
